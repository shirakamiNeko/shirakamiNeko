I'm a passionate, mostly self-taught software engineer (aka. an open-source and ACGM enthusiast) from Hong Kong, currently as a INFE student under EE department.

My coding jounery started at around age 8, the moment I knew `ipconfig` in Windows. However, considered I have started "real-programming" on late 2022 and building full-stack web applications since 2023, I'm actually not having that much of potential tbh...

You may already know me from Discord (My Discord account / Discord bot I made), my YouTube channel, my Instagram, my personal blog site... or if you haven't, nice to meet you 😊!

### OS

<br>

Oh, and the most important one, PVE 
<br>
<br>

I'm familiar with most of the Linux distro (except arch, at least for now since I run my services mostly on PVE)

Also, I'm relying on Adobe applications so much, which is why Windows was still in my top priority (pls don't ask me to use MacOS)

However, I would likely installing arch with custom dotfiles after the warranty of my laptop expires, so stay tunned!
